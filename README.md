# Pinboard

Firefox Quantum addon for [pinboard.in](https://pinboard.in).

## Features

This plugin replicates the functionality of the legacy plugin as closely as possible:

  * Address bar button with menu to allow
    * Add to pinboard
    * Read later
    * Access to various direct links on pinboard.in
  * Right-click context menu on links to allow
    * Add to pinboard
    * Read later

## Configuration

A single configuration option is added to enable/disable notifications, as per the original plugin.

## Todo/Issues

  * Adding tab sets is still todo
  * Read later opens a popup of 100x100, if you were not already logged into Pinboard it doesn't auto-close (this may be true of the old plugin)

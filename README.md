# Pinboard

Firefox Quantum addon for [pinboard.in](https://pinboard.in).

## Features

This plugin replicates the functionality of the legacy plugin as closely as possible:

  * Address bar button with menu to allow
    * Add to pinboard
    * Read later
    * Access to various direct links on pinboard.in
  * Right-click context menu on links to allow
    * Add to pinboard
    * Read later

In addition, an optional API key for Pinboard.in can be supplied via about:addons. 
Once an API key has been added the API status will show in the address bar popup. 
A URL which is already bookmarked will show the Pinboard icon with a green tick in the address bar.
